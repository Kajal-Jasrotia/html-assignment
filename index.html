Apart from this, I also like to draw and paint during free time. I don't have any previous experience in this education but I do have interest in arts and designs. I hope that I can learn new things like new tricks and techniques to increase my productivity. I hope that this course can help me to get familiar with, how to make proper utilization of technology in arts and designs to enhance it and make profitable outcomes.

<p>Moving to my other side, I was a very reserved person earlier. But now I can say i am not that much shy, I can easily call someone when needed.I love to eat and cook food and I have learned how to cook food from my mother. Moreover, I also learned how to make different dishes from you tube during covid 19 pandemic. I also love to sing songs and do some performances in front of mirror. I listen to every genre of music whether its rap, R&Bs, kpop, ballad, jazz and many more. This thing help me to learn new english words and enhance my english skills as well as vocabulary.
